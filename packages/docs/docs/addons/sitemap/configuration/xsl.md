# XSL

This plugin ships with some XSL files to make your sitemaps human readable. It adds some styling and does some reordering of the links.

These changes are by no means a requirement for your sitemap to be valid. It is really just there to make your sitemap look pretty.

If you have a large sitemap you might encounter performance issues when accessing the sitemap.xml from the browser. In that case you can disable the XSL to fix these issues.

###### Key: `xsl `

> `required:` NO | `type:` bool | `default:` true
