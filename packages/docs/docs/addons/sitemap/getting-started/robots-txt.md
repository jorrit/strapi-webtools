# ðŸ¤– Robots.txt

To make sure search engines are able to find the sitemap XML create a `robots.txt` file in the front-end of your website and add the following line:

```
Sitemap: https://your-strapi-domain.com/api/sitemap/index.xml
```

Read more about the `robots.txt` file [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/create-robots-txt).
