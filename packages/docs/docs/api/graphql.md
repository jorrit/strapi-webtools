# GraphQL API

As of writing this page there is no GraphQL API exposed by the Webtools core plugin. You might be able to still get most of it's functionality by querying the native Strapi GraphQL API, but this is not officially supported at this time.

If you want this feature to happen, go get involved on Github! Webtools is a rapidly growing plugin suitte for Strapi and community feedback is always appreciated.
