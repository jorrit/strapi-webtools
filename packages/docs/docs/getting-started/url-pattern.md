# ðŸ”Œ URL pattern
To create dynamic URLs this plugin uses **URL patterns**. The URL pattern will be used to generate unique URLs based on the data available.

You can add URL patterns in the settings section of the plugin.

```
/pages/[my-title-field]
```

Fields can be injected in the pattern by escaping them with `[]`.

The following field types are allowed in a pattern:

- `id`
- `uid`
- `string`

See below a screenshot of the URL pattern creation form in Strapi.
